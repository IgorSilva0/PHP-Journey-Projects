# Restaurant Webpage

Welcome to the Restaurant Webpage project! This project is part of my PHP learning journey, showcasing my ability to build a simple yet functional restaurant website.

## Overview

The Restaurant Webpage project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for a restaurant, including sections for the menu, about us, contact information, and more. It demonstrates the use of PHP for server-side scripting along with HTML and CSS for the frontend.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Welcomes visitors with an introduction to the restaurant.
- **Menu Page**: Displays the restaurant's menu items.
- **About Us Page**: Shares the restaurant's story and team information.
- **Contact Page**: Provides a form for customers to get in touch with the restaurant.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IgorSilva0/PHP-Journey-Projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd PHP-Journey-Projects
   ```
3. **Checkout the `restaurant-page` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout restaurant-page
   ```
4. **Start a local server** (e.g., using PHP's built-in server):
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
5. **Open your web browser and visit**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage

Navigate through the different pages of the website using the navigation bar. Each page is designed to showcase a different aspect of the restaurant.
